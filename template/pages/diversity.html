        <p>
          <strong>our mission:</strong> To promote an inclusive environment in the PostgreSQL community through outreach programs and the 
          support of educational endeavors for underrepresented PostgreSQL users in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>our priority: inclusion</strong>. Why? because inclusive communities help to reduce and eliminate barriers to participation, 
          and we want everyone to participate in the creation and innovation of software.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>what's the key?</strong> We believe that open-source software and communities are key for fostering inclusion in information 
          technology. Through community engagement, development, and support, as well as a philosophy that everyone is welcome, equal, and has 
          a role, open-source software communities are working to reduce and eliminate barriers to participation in information technology.  
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>it all comes together.</strong> Open Source is not just about permissive licenses that reduce economic barriers to using the 
          software - itâ€™s also about providing opportunities for everyone to participate in software development, research, advocacy, and 
          governance. We whole-heartedly believe in and support this at PgUS and consistently seek to create and support these opportunities 
          for participation through the work of the Diversity Committee, and beyond!
