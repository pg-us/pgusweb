      <p>
        The United States PostgreSQL Association provides financial support for a number of United States PostgreSQL activities - this is only made possible
        through the contributions of our fantastic community.
      </p>
      <p>
	    Please consider <a href="/sponsors">signing up as a sponsor</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also accept donations through <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4CCHD8NUXB4JG">PayPal</a> or
        with a credit card directly.  If you would like to donate using a credit card, please contact
        <a href="mailto:treasurer@postgresql.us">treasurer@postgresql.us</a> and we would be happy to generate an invoice for you.

        If your employer participates in the Benevity Workplace Giving Program, you can make donations to PgUS through payroll withholding.
        Some companies provide a matching amount as well! More information about Benevity can be found at <a href="https://www.benevity.com">www.benevity.com</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We are also registered with Nonprofit Connect (<a href="https://yourcause.com/">yourcause.com</a>), which operates a 
        similar workplace giving program for one-time or recurring donations, along with the option for an employer match.

        If you shop at Amazon, you can designate PgUS as your preferred recipient in the Amazon Smile donation program. 
        Amazon will donate 0.5% of your purchases to PgUS, with no effort required on your part once youâ€™ve selected PgUS 
        for the donations. Simply use <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/ch/26-2194507">this link</a>, log into your Amazon account, and shop as usual!

        If you are a PostgreSQL community-recognized user group, community-recognized conference, or educational speaker
        needing financial assistance, we may be able to provide financial sponsorship or other support.  Our assistance
        extends beyond the US to user groups, conferences, and speakers anywhere that we, as a US non-profit corporation,
        are legally able to provide assistance.  If you are in a region which has a community-recognized PostgreSQL
        organization which offers financial support, we recommend you contact them with your initial request before
        contacting PgUS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our assistance includes but is not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>supporting the needs of PostgreSQL user groups</li>
        <li>providing funds for educational speakers to attend events, either in-person or virtually</li>
        <li>assisting with trade show representation supplies</li>
        <li>covering the costs for swag creation (t-shirts, flyers, educational materials, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Those receiving financial sponsorship from PgUS maintain complete independence, are free to receive financial sponsorship from 
        other entities, and to unassociate themselves from PgUS at any time.
      </p>
