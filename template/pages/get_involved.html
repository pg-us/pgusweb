        <h3>Help our mission</h3>
        <p>
            The United States PostgreSQL Association provides financial support for a number of United States
            PostgreSQL
            activities - this is only made possible
            through the contributions of our fantastic community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please consider <a href="/sponsors">signing up as a sponsor</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also accept donations through <a
                href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4CCHD8NUXB4JG">PayPal</a> or

            <a href="mailto:treasurer@postgresql.us">treasurer@postgresql.us</a> and we would be happy to generate

            If you have any questions or concerns regarding PayPal donations (or if you have any suggestions for

            If your employer participates in the Benevity Workplace Giving Program, you can make donations to PgUS
            through
            payroll withholding.
            Some companies provide a matching amount as well! More information about Benevity can be found at <a
                href="https://www.benevity.com">www.benevity.com</a>.

        <p>
            We are also registered with Nonprofit Connect (<a href="https://yourcause.com/">yourcause.com</a>),
            which
            operates a
            similar workplace giving program for one-time or recurring donations, along with the option for an
            employer
            match.

            If you shop at Amazon, you can designate PgUS as your preferred recipient in the Amazon Smile donation
            program.
            Amazon will donate 0.5% of your purchases to PgUS, with no effort required on your part once youâ€™ve
            selected
            PgUS
            for the donations. Simply use <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/ch/26-2194507">this link</a>, log into
            your
            Amazon account, and shop as usual!
        </p>
        <p>
            We also accept checks and money orders, payable to the "United States PostgreSQL Association". We accept
            donations by mail to the address below:

        <h3>Committees</h3>
        <p>
            The United States PostgreSQL Association has a set of committees focused on various
            aspects of development and governance for the Association. The current committees are:
        </p>
        <h4>Diversity committee</h4>
        <p>
            The Diversity Committee promotes an inclusive environment in the PostgreSQL
            community through outreach programs and the support of educational
            endeavors for underrepresented PostgreSQL users in the United States.<br />
            The Diversity Committee can be contacted at
            <a href="mailto: diversity@postgresql.us"> diversity@postgresql.us</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Conference committee</h4>
        <p>
            The Conference Committee promotes the education of the public about PostgreSQL
            by running annual conferences, either directly or by working with an
            organization committee for the event, in particular the PostgresOpen
            national conference as well as smaller PgDay conferences around the
            country.<br />
            Stephen Frost is the current chair of the committee.<br />
            The Conference Committee can be contacted at
            <a href="mailto:ccomm@postgresql.us">ccomm@postgresql.us</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>User group committee</h4>
        <p>
            The User Group Committee promotes the education of the public about PostgreSQL
            by holding monthly, semi-monthly, or other regularly scheduled local
            meetings (aka "meetups") to bring together those interested in learning
            about PostgreSQL (either physcially or virtually), either directly or by
            working with local organizers of PostgreSQL User Groups (aka PUGs).<br />
            Dave Cramer is the current chair of the committee.<br />
            The User Group Committee can be contacted at
            <a href="mailto:ugcomm@postgresql.us">ugcomm@postgresql.us</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Expo committee</h4>
        <p>
            The Expo Committee promotes the use and education of PostgreSQL by
            exhibiting at various non-PostgreSQL events, either directly or by
            working with other volunteers, in-person or virtually, where those
            events are suitably aligned with PgUS's mission (eg: non-profit,
            volunteer-run general events such as SCALE, or open-source focused
            events such as FOSS4G).<br />
            Mark Wong is the current chair of the committee.<br />
            The Expo Committee can be contacted at
            <a href="mailto:ecomm@postgresql.us">ecomm@postgresql.us</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Selection process</h4>
        <p>
            The Committee Member Selection process is outlined on the <a href="/policies">policies page</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>A helping hand</h3>
        <p>
            If you are a PostgreSQL community-recognized user group, community-recognized conference, or educational
            speaker
            needing financial assistance, we may be able to provide financial sponsorship or other support. Our
            assistance
            extends beyond the US to user groups, conferences, and speakers anywhere that we, as a US non-profit
            corporation,
            are legally able to provide assistance. If you are in a region which has a community-recognized
            PostgreSQL
            organization which offers financial support, we recommend you contact them with your initial request
            before
            contacting PgUS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our assistance includes but is not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>supporting the needs of PostgreSQL user groups</li>
            <li>providing funds for educational speakers to attend events, either in-person or virtually</li>
            <li>assisting with trade show representation supplies</li>
            <li>covering the costs for swag creation (t-shirts, flyers, educational materials, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Those receiving financial sponsorship from PgUS maintain complete independence, are free to receive
            financial
            sponsorship from
            other entities, and to unassociate themselves from PgUS at any time.
        </p>
